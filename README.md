# saml-serializers

`saml-serializers` provides the following behaviours:
* Serialise OpenSAML Object to String
* Deserialise string to OpenSAML Object
* Transformer interface

As these behaviours are non-domain specific this library should be shared with any SAML consuming service that needs them.
